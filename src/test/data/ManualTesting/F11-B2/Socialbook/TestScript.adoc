== Test Script ==

*Getting started* +

Hi tester,  welcome to Social Book App:) As you have noticed, there will be some default data already populated in the
Social Book when you launch the app. Do familiarize yourself with the UI. The PersonListPanel is on the left, the
DetailedPersonCard is at the top of the screen, with the Web Browser below that, followed by the Result Display. The
Command Box is at the bottom, and this is where you will enter your CLI Commands.

We have prepared sample test data along with this test script to aid you in manual testing. You can find the relevant
test data named SampleData.xml in the same folder that you found this TestScript.adoc file. If the data folder does not exist,
launch the addressbook first, then close it. The data folder will now be generated. Delete the “addressbook.xml”
file in your data folder, then put a copy of this “SampleData.xml” file in the data folder and rename it to “addresbook.xml”.
You are now ready to begin testing.
